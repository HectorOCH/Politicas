# Vue Login Example

This example demonstrates a simple login form built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. User data is loaded from `users.json` to simulate a database.

## How to run

1. Serve the `login-app` directory using any static file server or open `index.html` directly in a browser.
2. Enter one of the credentials defined in `users.json` (e.g., `user1`/`pass1`).
3. The form will display whether the login was successful or not.
